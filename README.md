# Micro-Tiny GPT-2 Model FROM SCRATCH
This is our micro-tiny GPT-2 model (üòÅ we are still learning), built from scratch and inspired by the innovative approaches of Hugging Face Transformers and OpenAI architectures. Developed during our internship at [3D Smart Factory](https://3dsmartfactory.csit.ma/), this model showcases our committed efforts to create an advanced AI solution.

## NOTE

**Important:** This project involves fine-tuning various GPT-2 family models (small, medium, large, etc.) to develop two distinct chatbots: one for question and answer interactions [here](https://github.com/benisalla/fine-tune-gpt-2-chatbot) and another for context-based question and answer interactions [here](https://github.com/benisalla/fine-tune-gpt2_on_context_Q-A). Additionally, we have implemented a question and answer system based on the core transformer architecture which was initially used for translation tasks [here](https://github.com/benisalla/chatbot-based-translation-transformer).


**Note:** This is a learning project and does not represent a production-grade solution. The focus is on educational growth and experimentation.
